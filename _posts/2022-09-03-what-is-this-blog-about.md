So, what am I going to write about? Pretty much, I'm going to write about things the that interest me... to name a few: 

* Tiling
* Polyominoes
* Polyhedra
* Geometric Dissections
* Minimal Surfaces ( and soap bubbles )
* Cellular Automata
* Esoteric Programming Languages
* JavaScript
* Raspberry PI
* Emulation: BBC Micro / Commodore PET
* P5.js
* Rubik's Cube

Many of these posts will be puzzles, and a few of them will be proofs of some kind. A lot of them will be about projects that I've worked on at home.
Programming is what I do for a living, but I like doing it at home too. Most of this stuff is pretty nerdy, so it will help a lot if you're some kind of 
nerd :)

Some specific ideas for blog posts: 

* Proving that the R-heximono may have irreptile order of 121 or more.
* More irreptiles of the R-hexomino.
* Irregular Irreptiles.
* Irregular Rectifiable Polyominos.
* How to create a Costa Surface Soap bubble.
* Introducing Wireworld-1, a variant of Wireworld.
* Building a computer in Wireworld-1.
* DML - Directed Multigraph Language.
* DML Addition Server. 
* Rubik's Cube Simulator.
