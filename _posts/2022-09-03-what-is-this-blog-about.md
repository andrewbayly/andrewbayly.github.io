So, what am I going to write about? Pretty much, I'm going to write about things the that interest me... to name a few: 

* Tiling
* Polyominoes
* Polyhedra
* Geometric Dissections
* Minimal Surfaces ( and soap bubbles )
* Cellular Automata
* Esoteric Programming Languages
* JavaScript
* Raspberry PI
* Emulation: BBC Micro / Commodore PET
* P5.js
* Rubik's Cube

Many of these posts will be puzzles, and a few of them will be proofs of some kind. A lot of them will be about projects that I've worked on at home.
Programming is what I do for a living, but I like doing it at home too. Most of this stuff is pretty nerdy, so it will help a lot if you're some kind of 
nerd :)
