The starting point for this investigation is George Sicherman's [Hexomino Pair Rectangles](https://sicherman.net/n6rect2/index.html). In that page, he defines a hexomino pair rectangle as a rectangle that can be tiled by a pair of hexominoes using at least one of each. I add a constraint - hexominoes from one of the pair are not allowed to touch. I refer to the hexominoes as the isolating, and isolated hexomino.

In the table below, you will see number of tiles needed to for each pair of hexominoes. The rows are the isolating hexominoes, while the columns are the isolated hexomino.

## Hexomino Numbers

## Table of Results

In the table, the entries are the number of tiles needed, which are then referenced in the list of tilings below. Round brackets indicate that this tiling was already isolated in [Hexomino Pair Rectangles](https://sicherman.net/n6rect2/index.html), so refer back to that page to see the tiling. Tilings with hexomino #1, are a special case. These tilings are formed in a specific way, and pictures are not shown in the list below, nor in the table. To create such an isolated tiling, simply add bands of #1's across the tiling between each of the isolated tiles. Spaces in the table may indicate that a tiling is possible or impossible. Refer back to [Hexomino Pair Rectangles](https://sicherman.net/n6rect2/index.html) to understand which.
