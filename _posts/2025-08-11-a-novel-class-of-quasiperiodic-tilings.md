I have discovered a novel class of quasiperiodic tilings.

These quasiperiodic tilings are generated by a substitution rule where the vertex-star is a single regular polygon, with the vertex at its center. This polygon is fragmented and its pieces are distributed among the prototiles that meet at that vertex. This method differs from traditional substitution rules, which typically define the tiling based on how prototiles are subdivided or how their edges match up.

So far, in this class, I have found two tilings. The first is a 12-fold case which has dodecagons as vertices, and the second is an 8-fold case which has octagons as vertices.

The substitution rules and corresponding patches are shown below.
